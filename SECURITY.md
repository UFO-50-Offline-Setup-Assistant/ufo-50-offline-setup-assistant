We actively support the following versions of UFO 50 Offline Setup Assistant:

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Safe Usage
- **Offline First**: This tool is designed to work completely offline
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect any personal or usage data
- **Local Processing**: All configuration happens on your local machine
- **No Network Calls**: The assistant doesn't make any internet connections

### File System Access
- The assistant only accesses your UFO 50 installation directory
- Configuration files are stored locally in the application folder
- No system-wide changes are made without explicit user consent

### Antivirus Considerations
Some antivirus software may flag the assistant due to:
- Game file modification capabilities
- Direct executable launching
- Registry access (Windows only)

**This is a false positive**. The assistant is safe to use.
